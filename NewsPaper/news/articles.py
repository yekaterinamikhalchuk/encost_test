post_title1 = '7 Ways Small-Business Owners Can Cope with Inflation',
post_text1 = 'Small businesses that weathered the last two years face a new challenge: rising inflation. According ' \
             'to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the all-items index rose 7.0 percent for the 12 months ending December ' \
             '2021—the highest increase in 40 years. Steps That May Help Your Business Address Inflation. ' \
             'Key insights from small business owners reveal steps you can take that may be able to ease ' \
             'inflations effect on your business. 1. Streamline and automate processes. ' \
             'Stefani found that reorganizing his companys warehouse saved money. We invested 5,000 ' \
             'in new shelving. After installations, we found it nearly doubled productivity. Improving ' \
             'processes may mean exploring automation for your company, suggests Ben Johnston, ' \
             'COO of Kapitus, a provider of growth capital to small businesses. As the cost of labor continues ' \
             'to climb, re-examine processes, ' \
             'he advises. Could time-intensive work be automated? Is there software that can be deployed ' \
             'to automate business processes like scheduling, ' \
             'order taking, billing or collecting payments? Is robotic processing ' \
             'an opportunity when manufacturing a good or completing a repetitive task? ' \
             '2. Analyze profit margins. Examine your profit margins carefully, ' \
             'says Sam Barrante, an e-commerce entrepreneur. Start by re-evaluating your costs ' \
             'and then analyze what margins you are facing in todays economy. ' \
             'From there, start looking into solutions to increase those margins, while continuing to ' \
             'ensure quality products and services. 3. Improve productivity. ' \
             'The more quickly and efficiently you and your employees work, the higher your profit margins are ' \
             'likely to be. Use technologies and apps that track and improve productivity, ' \
             'says Cassel. 4. Cut expenses when and where possible.Reduce wherever you can, advises ' \
             'Bradley Katz, CEO and co-founder of Axon Optics, a therapeutic eyewear provider.  ' \
             'Consider downsizing your office,  says Katz.  For example, my business uses a hybrid ' \
             'remote/in-office model that allows the flexibility to move to a smaller, ' \
             'less expensive office. Also check if your company is paying for products or services that arent ' \
             'being used and cancel those items. Also consider substituting materials. ' \
             'You may find alternate products or ingredients that will save you money.5. Stock up on supplies ' \
             'now.Evan McCarthy has helped to insulate his company against inflation ' \
             'while also addressing supply chain issues by stocking up on core materials. We reorganized our ' \
             'warehouse and now have pallets full of supplies reaching to the ceiling ' \
             'in the 10,000-square-foot space,  says McCarthy, the president of Sporting Smiles, which' \
             ' provides custom dental products.  We stocked up, because every time we ' \
             'ordered supplies, the price kept rising. Our cardboard box supplies had ' \
             'three major increases in 2021. Also consider renegotiating contracts with suppliers ' \
             'and buying large equipment now, as prices are likely to increase.6. ' \
             'Raise prices judiciously.While raising prices isnt ideal, it may be ' \
             'helpful in combatting inflations effect on your business. Avoid turning off ' \
             'customers with dramatic across-the-board price increases. ' \
             'Instead, raise prices slowly in modest increments and be strategic. Choose ' \
             'areas where customers are less likely to notice.7. Be ready for new customers.  ' \
             'Inflation automatically creates new customer segments, so go after them,  ' \
             'suggests Stuart Robles, a partner at Briggs Capital, a mergers and acquisitions ' \
             'firm for small and medium-sized businesses, and co-author of The New World ' \
             'of Entrepreneurship: Insiders Guide to Buying and Selling Your Own Business ' \
             'in the Digital Age. Inflationary periods are unnerving to many,  says Robles.  ' \
             'As a result, customer segments and market niches previously unreachable can become ' \
             'attainable as your company is seen as a beacon of light in terms of potential ' \
             'lower prices and rates. The information contained herein is for generalized ' \

post_text2 = 'Most Australians have followed health advice to wear face masks and have COVID-19 ' \
             'vaccinations. Actions like these that benefit others are known in psychology as ' \
             'prosocial behaviours. In a COVID context, prosocial behaviours reduce the spread of ' \
             'the virus and keep health-care institutions functioning. What does sport have to do with ' \
             'civic values? Adolescence is an important time for developing civic values. Personal life ' \
             'experiences, relationships and social contexts all influence this development. These ' \
             'contexts can include home, school and extracurricular activities such as sport. Sport ' \
             'requires us to work with others to achieve team goals. In this way, it can help children ' \
             'to develop attributes such as altruism and empathy. Unfortunately, in elite sports, ' \
             'gamesmanship, greed, cheating and a win-at-any-cost mentality can sometimes be elevated ' \
             'above positive virtues such as courage, co-operation and sportsmanship. In our study, many ' \
             'student teachers referred to news reports with negative messages about cheating, doping and ' \
             'racism. Sport has recently been a victim of the COVID-19 pandemic. Events have been cancelled ' \
             'and games played in empty stadiums. But sport has also been a shining light for people ' \
             'struggling in lockdown. This was particularly true of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. ' \
             'The International Olympic Committee (IOC) described the event as a beacon of hope after ' \
             'so much of normal life was brought to a standstill. Other commentators have similarly said ' \
             'Tokyo made sport a shining light in the gloom and described the Games as such a welcomed ' \
             'distraction, really highlighted how much sport can bring a smile to people’s faces. ' \
             'So, how do we maximise the benefits? Teaching students about civic values and sport as ' \
             'part of the school curriculum isn’t the only way to foster prosocial behaviour. ' \
             'We can reap its broader benefits for a healthier society by encouraging young people ' \
             'to play sport at school and in the community.'

post_text3 = 'UNESCO has designated the worlds first biosphere to span across five different countries - ' \
            'and theyre all in Europe. The new biosphere reserve covers an area of 700km and includes parts ' \
            'of Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary and Serbia. The basis of the biosphere is a ' \
            'route along the Mura, Drava and Danube rivers that wind through these five European ' \
            'nations. Dubbed the Amazon of Europe, the biosphere is precedent-setting as a multinational ' \
            'effort to curb ecological destruction. It is the largest river-based protected area in the ' \
            'entirety of Europe.What is a biosphere and why is it important? Biospheres are crucial for ' \
            'ecological restoration as their UNESCO protected status ensures an areas biodiversity and ' \
            'ecological structures, like floodplains, are protected from outside destructive interests.' \
            'The Mura, Drava and Danube biosphere will protect floodplains, forests, sand and gravel banks, ' \
            'steep banks, and backwaters. It will also look after a huge number of animal species, including ' \
            'the highest density of breeding white-tailed eagles in continental Europe.Why was this biosphere ' \
            'created? The five countries involved in the biosphere have worked for a long time to receive the ' \
            'UNESCO designation. The process began in 2009 when the governments of Croatia and Hungary signed a ' \
            'joint declaration committing to the protection of a cross-border biosphere reserve. All five countries ' \
            'environmental ministers then made a joint declaration in favour of the reserve in 2011. Following this, ' \
            'each of the countrys parts of the rivers involved received biosphere reserve status. First Croatia and ' \
            'Hungary in 2012, with Serbia, Slovenia, and Austria joining in 2017, 2018, and 2019 respectively. ' \
            'Are there more biospheres in the EU and beyond? This biosphere is a success of EU coordination and ' \
            'will go some way to reversing the damage to floodplains in the region. The biosphere will contribute' \
            ' to the EUs Green New Deal. This is the commissions proposed method of transforming the EUs economy ' \
            'to get to no net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050. It also promises to move away from ' \
            'creating economic growth through the use of non-sustainable resources. Outside of the EU, ' \
            'there are many other biospheres that could benefit from a similar UNESCO status. UNESCO ' \
            'has a database of biosphere reserves. Included are 714 biosphere reserves in 129 countries, ' \
            'including 21 transboundary sites. Other transboundary biospheres include the Vosges du ' \
            'Nord/Pfälzerwald region across France and Germany. Originally receiving its designation ' \
            'in 1998, the area shares water, sandstone and forests.'
